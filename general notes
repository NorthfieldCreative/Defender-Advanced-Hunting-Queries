user activity is generally reported from the Microsoft Office and Defender for Endpoint tables.

Defender for Endpoint consists of the following 10 tables: DeviceEvents, DeviceFileCertificatelnfo, DeviceFileEvents, DevicelmageLoadEvents, Devicelnfo, DeviceLogonEvents, DeviceNetworkEvents, DeviceNetworklnfo, DeviceProcessEvents, and DeviceRegistryEvents.

if you have the Defender for 365 Data Connector enabled for Microsoft Sentinel and you enable the Microsoft Defender for Office 365 logs, the OfficeActivity table isnâ€™t the only Microsoft Office data you can query. Enabling these logs gives you access to EmailEvents, EmailUrlInfo, EmailAttachmentInfo, and EmailPostDeliveryEvents tables
